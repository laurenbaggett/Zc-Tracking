% kalman_filter_whale
% Take localized points from Where's Whaledo loc3D_DOA_intersect and smooth
% them by applying a Kalman filter. Model covariance matrices using correlated random walk,
% and finish with moving average smoothing.

%
% Inputs:
% whaleIn: the whale struct that is outputted from your loc3D intersect step
% vel: the average velocity (meters / second) you assume the whale is moving, get from
%       literature
% win: the number of detections that you would like to consider in your
%       moving average. This step further smooths your detections. If you would
%       not like to calculate a moving average, set this value at 1.
% maxtimegap: the maximum time gap (seconds) allowed between points that you are
%       interpolating through. If you encounter a time gap larger than this
%       threshold, no smoothed position for that period will be generated.
%
% Example input:
% whale = kalman_filter_whale(whale,1,20,60);
%   ** these are the settings that I typically use for beaked whales (Zc).
%       Modify as necessary for your species of interest.
